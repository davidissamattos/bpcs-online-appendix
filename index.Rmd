# Foreword

This is the online appendix for the paper *"Bayesian Paired-Comparison with the bpcs package"*. It contains a commented and reproducible code for all the analysis, tables and plots presented in the paper.

In the beginning of each study, we show a few lines of the original datasets. These datasets are either available through a link in the paper or through asking the authors directly. Therefore we do not provide or distribute the data in this appendix (or in the code repository).
